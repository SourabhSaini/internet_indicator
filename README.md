# internet_indicator
Dragable Indicator which will show if the internet is working or not.

It is a very simple python script written in Python version 3.x.
It will create a small draggable and translucent box on the right bottom corner of your desktop.

Green color means Internet is working fine.
Red color means Internet is not working fine/having some issues.

In order to run the script, type:
$ python3 [path_of_file]/internet_indicator.py
